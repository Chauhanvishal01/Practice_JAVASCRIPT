Objects
Create an object representing a book with properties like title, author, and numberOfPages. Access and print each property.
Write a function that takes an object representing a person with properties like name, age, and city, and prints a formatted string introducing the person.

Write a function that adds a new property to an existing object.
Write a function that deletes a property from an object.
Write a function that checks if a property exists in an object.



DOM Manipulation
Create a button and a paragraph element in HTML. Write a JavaScript function that changes the text of the paragraph when the button is clicked.
Create an input box and a button in HTML. Write a JavaScript function that displays an alert with the text entered in the input box when the button is clicked.
Create a list in HTML. Write a JavaScript function that adds a new item to the list each time a button is clicked.
Create a div in HTML. Write a JavaScript function that changes the background color of the div when a button is clicked.
Create a simple form in HTML with fields for name and email. Write a JavaScript function that validates the form, ensuring both fields are filled out before submission.


array

Slicing an Array:

Create a new array slicedArray that contains elements from myArray starting from index 2 to index 4 (inclusive). Log slicedArray.
Sorting an Array:

Sort myArray in ascending order. Log the sorted array.
Reversing an Array:

Reverse myArray. Log the reversed array.
Finding Maximum Element:

Find and log the maximum number from myArray.
Finding Minimum Element:

Find and log the minimum number from myArray.

Filtering an Array:

Create a new array filteredArray that contains only even numbers from myArray. Log filteredArray.
Mapping an Array:

Create a new array mappedArray that doubles each element of myArray. Log mappedArray.
Reducing an Array:

Use reduce to calculate the sum of all elements in myArray. Log the sum.
Copying an Array:

Create a copy of myArray named copyArray. Modify copyArray (e.g., change an element) and log both myArray and copyArray to demonstrate that they are independent.
Checking Array Type:

Check if myArray is an array. Log true if it is, otherwise log false.
Combining Array Methods:

Given an array of numbers, first filter out odd numbers, then square each remaining number, and finally calculate the sum of squared numbers. Log the result.
Tips for Practicing:
Start with simpler tasks and gradually move to more complex ones.
Use the browser console or a code editor with a JavaScript environment to test your code.
Refer to the Mozilla Developer Network (MDN) documentation for detailed explanations and examples of array methods and operations.
These questions cover a range of basic array operations and are designed to help you become familiar with manipulating arrays in JavaScript. Happy coding!
